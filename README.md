# 📝 TaskMaster – SaaS To-Do List App with Auth & Payments

TaskMaster is a simple yet fully functional To-Do List (TDL) web application built with **Vite.js** (React), featuring:

- ✅ **User Authentication** via [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- 💳 **Premium Subscription System** via [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- 🗂️ **User-specific persistent data storage**
- 🌐 **Deployed on Vercel**
- 🔁 **Stripe ↔ Supabase Integration via Webhooks & Supabse Edge Functions**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **complete SaaS architecture**: authentication, user-specific data, payment flow, and subscription management — and serves as a boilerplate for other use cases.

## 🚀 Features

- **Sign up / Sign in** using Supabase Auth
